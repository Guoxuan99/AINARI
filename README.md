# AINARI
Hackathon - AINARI - image classification task to predict possible paddy disease

My role in the project is mainly to train and test the image classification and object detection model by using Azure Machine Learning Designer, AutoML and Custom Vision.
Therefore, there are less coding involved because Microsoft Azure Machine Learning is a collection of services and tools intended to help developers train and 
deploy machine learning models through its Azure public cloud.

However, we are also using **[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vkZQNxAoq5Va8CfmEQgL-lcOGdkBxbeC?usp=sharing)** to try out other model to compare the accuracy.
From what we get, the models in Azure perform better.
